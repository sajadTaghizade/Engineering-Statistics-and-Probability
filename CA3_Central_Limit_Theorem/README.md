        Problem 1: Sampling and the Central Limit Theorem
      </h3>
      <p>
        An empirical demonstration of the CLT. This section shows how the sampling distribution of the mean, derived from various non-normal distributions (<strong>Poisson, Exponential, Geometric</strong>), converges to a Normal distribution as the sample size increases. The analysis includes observing changes in the mean and standard error of the sampling distributions.

        Problem 2: Applications of Mean Squared Error (MSE)
      </h3>
      <p>
        This problem focuses on using the principle of minimizing MSE to estimate unknown parameters. It covers two key applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Linear Regression</strong>: Estimating the slope and intercept of a linear function that best fits a set of data points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Geometric Center</strong>: Finding the central coordinate for a cluster of 2D points.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The solutions are derived by finding the point where the partial derivatives of the MSE function equal zero.

        Problem 3: CLT Applied to the Bernoulli Distribution
      </h3>
      <p>
        A deep dive into how the <strong>Normal distribution serves as a powerful approximation for the Binomial distribution</strong>. This is a direct consequence of the CLT, as the Binomial distribution is a sum of independent Bernoulli trials.
