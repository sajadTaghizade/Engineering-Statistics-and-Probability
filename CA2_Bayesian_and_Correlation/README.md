        Problem 1: Joint & Conditional Distributions
      </h3>
      <p>
        This problem focuses on the analysis of a simulated <strong>Queueing System</strong>. The goal is to explore the statistical properties of different time variables (arrival, wait, service) by visualizing their individual, joint, and conditional distributions, as well as calculating their correlation.

        Problem 2: Bayesian Estimation
      </h3>
      <p>
        The objective is to estimate the fairness of a coin (the probability of heads, Î¸) using <strong>Bayesian inference</strong>. The process starts with an initial belief (a prior distribution, e.g., Uniform) which is then sequentially updated with new data (likelihood from coin flips) to form a final posterior distribution for Î¸. The effect of different priors is also analyzed.

        Problem 3: Covariance and Correlation Coefficient
      </h3>
      <p>
        A time-series analysis of an <strong>hourly electricity consumption dataset</strong> (<code>energy.csv</code>) from 2004 to 2018. This part uses visualization tools like boxplots and correlation calculations to uncover patterns in energy usage. It also explores the critical concept of "correlation does not imply causation" using a second dataset.
