        Problem 1: Hypergeometric & Binomial Distributions
      </h3>
      <p>
        This problem involves simulating an election audit process to explore the properties of the <strong>Hypergeometric distribution</strong>. It includes comparing simulated results with theoretical values and analyzing the convergence of the Hypergeometric distribution to the <strong>Binomial distribution</strong> as the population size increases.

        Problem 2: Normal Approximation & Continuity Correction
      </h3>
      <p>
        This section focuses on using the <strong>Normal distribution</strong> to approximate Binomial probabilities in an event attendance scenario. The analysis includes evaluating the impact of <strong>continuity correction</strong> on accuracy and comparing the computational trade-offs between exact (Binomial) and approximate (Normal) calculations.

        Problem 3: Memorylessness of Exponential Distribution
      </h3>
      <p>
        An empirical investigation into the <strong>memoryless property</strong> of the Exponential distribution. This is demonstrated by simulating customer arrival times and showing that the probability of a future arrival is independent of how long one has already waited.

        Problem 4: Functions of Random Variables
      </h3>
      <p>
        This problem demonstrates how to generate random variables from specific distributions by transforming other distributions. It covers two key transformations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Logarithmic Transform</strong>: Converting a Uniform distribution to an Exponential one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Box-Muller Transform</strong>: Converting two independent Uniform distributions into two independent standard Normal distributions.
        </li>
      </ul>
